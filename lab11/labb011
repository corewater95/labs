tcpdump command:sudo tcpdump -i eth0 host www.google.com -A

How many packets were captured? 1878.
Looking through the output, what traffic are you seeing? i see port number and the destionion ip adress packet size and sequance number.
Fancy tcpdump command:sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -nnvvXSs 1514 -w capture_file.pcap 'host www.google.com for port 80 

Capturing google.com traffic:curl http://www.google.com

Was there a difference in output from curl when using http or https?sudo tcpdump -i eth0 host www.google.com -w https_capture.pcap , there were more charctires in http.
Was there a difference in packet content in tcpdump when using http or https? yes 
What caused the difference?:the http using Packets captured using tcpdump for HTTP traffic will contain readable text, including HTML, headers, and other content in clear text.
the https using to secure way encrypted data thats why the outcome is diffrent. 
Save capture to a file:For HTTP: http_capture.pcap
For HTTPS: https_capture.pcap
Read capture from a file:sudo tcpdump -i eth0 host www.google.com -w https_capture.pcap

Don't forget to commit and push your capture to your Lab11 folder.
